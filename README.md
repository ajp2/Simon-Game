# Simon Game

This is a game of memory where the user must repeat a sequence of flashes corresponding to one of four coloured buttons. The number of flashes increments each level, so the game gets progressively harder as the user passes each level. The series of flashes must be reproduced in order.

The user also has the option of turning on strict mode. In this mode, if the user makes a mistake the game is reset. In easy mode the user is brought back to the start of the current level.

The user can win the game by successfully completing level 20.
